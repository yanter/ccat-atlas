I'll explain the code below, but if you just want to see the code, you can skip to the end.\n\n## How to create a gradient underline\n\nWe create this as an `absolute` positioned element, which requires the parent element to be `relative`. This allows us to position the element relative to the parent (surpise). In this case we are going to have it underline the parent element, although you could adjust this positioning.\n\n### Gradient underline color\n\nWe're going to use the `bg-gradient-to-r` utility to create a gradient from left to right. Direction really doesn't matter, the point is that it's a gradient. For the starting color we're going to make it transparent, go to your desired color, and go back to transparent. We can do this with the utilities `bg-gradient-to-r from-sky-500/0 via-sky-500/70 to-sky-500/0`. This will create a gradient from transparent to `sky-500` to transparent. You can adjust the opacity of the middle color to whatever you want. I chose `70` because it looked good to me.\n\n### Gradient underline height\n\nLet's set the height of the underline to `h-px`. This will make it 1px tall. You can adjust this to whatever you want.\n\n### Positioning the gradient underline\n\nWe want the gradient underline to span the bottom edge of the parent element. So the first utility we want to use is `inset-x-0` to have it go from the left edge to the right edge, then `bottom-0` to put it at the bottom. You can find more info about these utilities in the [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/top-right-bottom-left#placing-a-positioned-element).\n\nIf you need to adjust the vertical location of the underline, you can do so using the `bottom` utility. For instance, if you want to move it down slightly to overlap a bottom border, you can use `-bottom-px` to move it down 1px.\n\n## Final code\n\n### Generic gradient underline\n\nHere I use the color `sky-500` from the Tailwind color palette. You can use whatever color you want.\n\n```html\n\u003Cdiv class=\"relative\">\n  \u003Cspan\n    class=\"absolute inset-x-0 bottom-0 h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-sky-500/0 via-sky-500/70 to-sky-500/0\"\n  >\u003C/span>\n\u003C/div>\n```\n\n### Link underline on hover\n\nThis is very similar to the above, but I've added a hover effect to the underline. There's also a transition because who doesn't like transitions?\n\n![](../tailwind-gradient-underline/spongebob-transitions.jpeg)\n\n```html\n\u003Cbutton class=\"group relative border-2 p-2\">\n  My Link!\n  \u003Cspan\n    class=\"absolute inset-x-0 -bottom-px h-px bg-gradient-to-r from-sky-500/0 via-sky-500/70 to-sky-500/0 opacity-0 transition group-hover:opacity-100\"\n  >\u003C/span>\n\u003C/button>\n```","src/data/blog/en/tailwind-gradient-underline/index.mdx",[113],"../tailwind-gradient-underline/heroImage.jpg","74fc56385072b992","zh/best-vscode-extensions-front-end-developers",{"id":115,"data":117,"body":127,"filePath":128,"assetImports":129,"digest":131,"deferredRender":23},{"title":118,"description":119,"authors":120,"pubDate":122,"updatedDate":123,"heroImage":124,"categories":125,"draft":60},"15 Best VSCode Extensions for Front-End Developers in 2023","The top VSCode extensions for frontend developers to improve productivity and code quality.",[121],{"id":24,"collection":9},["Date","2023-08-05T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2025-04-15T00:00:00.000Z"],"__ASTRO_IMAGE_../best-vscode-extensions-front-end-developers/heroImage.jpg",[126],"productivity","Don't be a code monkey.

We will add a `paths` and `baseUrl` property to the `compilerOptions` object. Each path is relative to the `baseUrl`.\n\nThis will tell TypeScript to replace the alias with the actual path when compiling the code.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\", // root of your \"paths\" below. Required if \"paths\" is defined\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@components/*\": [\"src/components/*\"] // enables us to use @components/MyComponent\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Using Path Aliases In Your Code\n\nNow in all of your source files, you can import components like this:\n\n```ts\n// Without path aliases\nimport Hero from \"../../../components/Hero\";\nimport Footer from \"../../../components/Footer\";\n\n// With path aliases\nimport Hero from \"@components/Hero\";\nimport Footer from \"@components/Footer\";\n```\n\n\u003CAdmonition variant=\"info\">\n  Frameworks like Astro and Next.js ship with built-in typescript support,\n  although you may have to create the file `tsconfig.json`. Consult your\n  framework's documentation for more information.\n\u003C/Admonition>\n\n## Why Should I Do This?\n\nLet's say we have the following file structure:\n\n```\n.\n└── src/\n    ├── components/\n    │   ├── Hero.tsx\n    │   └── Footer.tsx\n    └── pages/\n        ├── index.tsx\n        └── solutions.tsx\n```\n\n### Annoying Relative Imports\n\nIf we want to import `Hero.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` into `index.tsx` and `solutions.tsx`, we would need the following import statements:\n\n```ts\nimport Hero from \"../components/Hero\";\nimport Footer from \"../components/Footer\";\n```\n\n### Refactoring Relative Imports\n\nNow lets say we want to refactor. We now have multiple \"solutions\" and want to have each on their own page, and have them under a `solutions` directory. The file structure now looks like:\n\n```\n.\n└── src/\n    ├── components/\n    │   ├── Hero.tsx\n    │   └── Footer.tsx\n    └── pages/\n        ├── index.tsx\n        └── solutions/\n            ├── solution.tsx\n            └── solution2.tsx\n```\n\nNow we have to update the import paths of `solution.tsx`:\n\n```ts\nimport Hero from \"../../components/Hero\";\nimport Footer from \"../../components/Footer\";\n```\n\nYou can see how this makes refactoring more of a chore. We have to update the import paths in every file that imports these components. This is a huge time sink and can lead to bugs if you forget to update the import paths.\n\n### Alias Imports Version\n\nAlternatively, if from the start we were using aliases, we would not have to update any files using the components. This is far better for maintainability:\n\n```ts\nimport Hero from \"@components/Hero\";\nimport Footer from \"@components/Footer\";\n```\n\n\u003CAdmonition variant=\"info\">\n  With this method, *every* file that needs to import these components will\n  import them the same way. This makes it easier to move files around without\n  having to update import paths.\n\u003C/Admonition>\n\n## Additional Paths\n\nThis can be extended to any number of path aliases. Some other potential ones you might use:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@config/*\": [\"src/data/*\"],\n      \"@js/*\": [\"src/js/*\"],\n      \"@layouts/*\": [\"src/layouts/*\"],\n      \"@components/*\": [\"src/components/*\"],\n      \"@assets/*\": [\"src/assets/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\u003CAdmonition variant=\"tip\">\n  When updating `tsconfig.json`, you may need to restart your editor for the\n  changes to take effect.\n\u003C/Admonition>","src/data/blog/zh/tsconfig-paths-setup/index.mdx",[172],"../tsconfig-paths-setup/heroImage.jpg","1f25fd1160eb8945","zh/tailwind-gradient-underline",{"id":174,"data":176,"body":110,"filePath":182,"assetImports":183,"digest":114,"deferredRender":23},{"title":101,"description":102,"authors":177,"pubDate":180,"heroImage":107,"categories":181,"draft":60},[178,179],{"id":24,"collection":9},{"id":11,"collection":9},["Date","2023-07-10T00:00:00.000Z"],[109],"src/data/blog/zh/tailwind-gradient-underline/index.mdx",[113],"en/the-great-egg-hunt-2025",{"id":184,"data":186,"body":196,"filePath":197,"assetImports":198,"digest":200,"deferredRender":23},{"title":187,"description":187,"authors":188,"pubDate":190,"updatedDate":191,"heroImage":192,"categories":193,"draft":60},"The
